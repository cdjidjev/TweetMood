# Real-Time Monitoring of Public Opinion on Twitter Using Sentiment and Emotion Analysis

## Project Overview

This data science project focuses on the development of a real-time machine learning system for sentiment and emotion analysis of Twitter data. By harnessing natural language processing techniques such as NLTK and vader_lexicon for sentiment analysis and leveraging the SemEval 2018 - Task E-c dataset for emotion classification, our project aims to provide valuable insights into the ever-evolving landscape of public opinion on various Twitter topics.

## Project Details

### Methodology

Our methodology involves several key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We conduct extensive data preprocessing, which includes cleaning, text vectorization, and machine learning model training. We employ various machine learning algorithms such as BernoulliNB, LogisticRegression, and LinearSVC.

2. **Sentiment and Emotion Analysis**: We analyze sentiments and emotions in tweets, linking them to the corresponding categories, and visualize the results in an informative manner.

### Project Phases

The project is structured into three main phases:

1. **Sentiment Trend Analysis**: We analyze how sentiment trends evolve over time.

2. **Emotion Identification**: We use machine learning techniques to identify emotions in tweets.

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: We implement real-time sentiment and emotion monitoring on specific topics of interest.

## Visual Representations

We provide the following visual representations based on tweets collected with the keyword "covid":

- **Figure 2**: A bipartite graph displaying the strength of relationships between different elements.
- **Figure 3**: A dynamic plot showing the average change in emotions per batch of tweets over time.
- **Figure 4**: A dynamic plot illustrating the average change between negative and positive sentiments per batch of tweets over time.
- **Figure 5**: A dynamic plot presenting the frequency of different emotions per batch of tweets over time.

## Project Goal

Our ultimate goal is to develop a powerful real-time tool for tracking sentiment and emotions across a wide range of Twitter topics. This tool will offer valuable insights into public opinion trends and dynamics, contributing to the understanding of social sentiment in real-time.
